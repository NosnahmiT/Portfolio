            My name is Tim Hanson. I am a UX Designer based in Brooklyn, NY. 
            Originally from Des Moines, Iowa, I earned my degree in business administration and marketing from Grand View University. 
            I then went on to earn my certification in UX/UI Design from Denver University.
          </p>
          <p class="text-weight-normal mt-3">
            I have always considered myself a jack of all trades, master of none. 
            I've pursued many professions in my life. 
            I've worked as an assistant brewer and then a cook. 
            I had a brief stint at the United States postal carrier. 
            I've interned on a political campaign, and I've worked retail in the height of the COVID pandemic. 
            It took me a long time find something that stuck. When I did that was UX Design. 
            I am a creative and endlessly curious person and I wanted to work in something that fostered that. 
            A friend of mine told me about UX design and it immediately piqued my interest. I was immediately interested in it. 
            I entered a bootcamp and immersed myself in the field. 
            Eight months later I started my first job as a UX Designer and I haven't looked back.
          </p>
          <p class="text-weight-normal mt-3">
            Having worked in varying and unpredictable environments I have grown adept at reading situations and stepping up into leadership roles or falling back and taking guidance. 
            I have often worked closely with others seeing projects through beginning to end and have become very comfortable in team environments. 
            With a business background, an eye for design, paired with a strong work ethic I can make myself a valuable asset to any team. 
            I look forward to collaborating with you soon.
